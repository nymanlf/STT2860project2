## Visualizations

### Background of the Data

The datasets were downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You can find the links to their descriptions in the `docsreference` folder.

### Create Analysis Datasets

Complete and run the two scripts found in the `docscripts` folder. Your processed datasets all should be written into the `dataprocessed` folder. Load the resulting `.Rdata` file above under the **Setup** header and use `glimpse()` to explore the structure of each dataset.

#### Dataset #1

The `dplus` dataset contains a variable that gives information about the `rating` for each program offering. Convert the variable into a factor that puts the ratings in (roughly) ascending order of age restriction/audience: `TV-Y`, `TV-Y7`, `TV-Y7-FV`, `TV-G`, `G`, `TV-PG`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `TV-14`. If the `date_added` variable is not already in date format, convert it.  

```{r factorratings}
readRDS("../dataprocessed/dplus.rds")

factordplus <- dplus %>% mutate(rating = factor(rating, levels = c("TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-Y7-FV", "TV-G", "G", "TV-PG", "PG", "PG-13", "TV-14"))) 


print(factordplus)
```

#### Dataset #2

In the `strmtv` dataset, create a new variable that tells you the total number of streaming services that offer each included program.

```{r numberofsvcs}
strmtv <- strmtv %>% rename_with(~ gsub('[[:punct:]]', '', .x)) 

strmtv <- clean_names(strmtv)


strmtv <- strmtv %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
    mutate(total_sum = sum(c(netflix, hulu, prime_video, disney),na.rm = TRUE))

strmtv <- na.omit(strmtv)
print(strmtv)
```

### Part 1: Violin Plot

Create a violin plot of `release_year` (x-axis) grouped by `type` of program (y-axis) for programs on Disney+. Fill with a color of your choice. Add a boxplot inside the violin plot, as you did in one of the DataCamp exercises. Re-scale the x-axis so that tick marks appear at whole-decade intervals (e.g., 1980, 1990, 2000). Add an appropriate title and axis labels. Use other formatting as you choose to enhance effectiveness/appearance.

```{r}

violin_plot <- ggplot(dplus, aes(x = release_year, y = type, fill = release_year)) +
                geom_violin(fill = "magenta", alpha = .9, width = 1.5) +
                scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1920,1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030)) + 
                labs(title= "Types of movies based on release year on the Disney Plus platform", x = "Release Year", y = "Type of Movie") +
                geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", alpha = .7, width = .2)

print(violin_plot)
```

### Part 2: Waffle Plot

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/shrekdonkey.gif")
```

Create a waffle plot to show the distribution of program `type` on Disney+. 

* Give the plot the title "Streaming Content on Disney+". 
* Change the colors of the squares to something other than the defaults.
* Use an x-axis label to indicate roughly how many programs each square represents.

Hint: You can use `count()` to find out how many of each `type` of program there is, then use `prop.table(n)` in a mutate statement (along with some other math) to get percentages. Other methods are also possible.

```{r}

```

### Part 3: Bar Plot

Create a horizontal barplot to show the frequencies of the various `rating` categories for programs on Disney+ (i.e., use `y =` rather than `x =` for the variable you are plotting). Use faceting by `type` so that you have side-by-side plots for the different program types. Add an appropriate title and axis labels, as well as other formatting of your choice to enhance effectiveness/appearance.

```{r}

dplus <- na.omit(dplus)
barplotH <- ggplot(dplus, aes( y = rating)) +
            geom_bar(fill = "lightblue")+
            labs(title = "Number of rated movies on disney plus", x = "how many movies", y = "Movie rating") 
  

print(barplotH)


  
```


## Question

**Question 1:** Based on your plots, make five informational statements or comparisons regarding the Disney+ streaming service.

**ANSWER**

1) Disney Plus provides almost equal amounts of G and Pg rated movies on its platform. 

2) Disney plus provides movies that are released more recently. When you look at the Violin plot it is weighted much heavier twards the modern date. 

3) Almost all of Disney Plus' movie selection were made in the United States.

4) Disney Plus has slightly more movies on its platform compared to TV shows. 

5) On the whole TV shows were released later so it is in a way skewed towards having more movies on the platform due to movies being more popular in earlier years. 

**Question 2:** What other data would you like to have, or which existing variables would you like to see transformed, if you were going to do further explorations or visualizations? Give at least two examples.

**ANSWER**
I think I would like to have had genre of movies included because it could provide some clarity on which streaming platforms have certain types of movies. When displaying info about movies to me genre is really important.
