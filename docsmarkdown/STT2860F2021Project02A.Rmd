### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from their [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page, which also contains variable definitions.

### Create Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets above under the **Setup** header and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Use your code from Project 1 and/or draw from the Project 1 solutions to assemble a dataset below that meets the following criteria. Use `datatable()` from the DT package to display the result.

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}

### if time come back and reorder this code because it wont run smooth due to order

# made all of the heights their actual value for the sake of clean readability 
galtonfamiliessub1 <- galtonfamiliessub %>% mutate(
    Father = FatherR + 60,
    Mother = MotherR + 60,
    Height = HeightR + 60
  ) %>%
  select(FamilyID, Children, Father, Mother, Child, Height)

galtonfamiliesjoined <- galtonfamiliessub1 %>%
  mutate(FamilyID = as.character(FamilyID)) %>%
  bind_rows(galtonfamiliesmain)  



# changed data to numerical within familyid

galtonfamiliesjoined1 <- galtonfamiliesjoined %>% 
         mutate(FamilyID = as.numeric(ifelse(FamilyID == "136A", 205, FamilyID)))
# calculate the average of both parents heights and save it as midparent then add midparent to the dataframe
galtonfamiliesjoined2 <-  galtonfamiliesjoined1 %>% mutate(midparent = (Father + Mother) / 2)
 
data_fams_mutated <- galtonfamiliesjoined2 %>%
  mutate(
    Midparent = (1.08 * Mother + Father) / 2,
    Height = ifelse(Child == "Daughter", 1.08 * Height, Height)
  )
#arrange data into the correct order
  galtonfamiliesordered <- data_fams_mutated %>% arrange(FamilyID, desc(Child), desc(Height))
 
 datatable(galtonfamiliesordered)
 
#renamed columns
galtonfamilies_A <- rename(galtonfamiliesordered,
                            familyid = FamilyID,
                            num_children = Children,
                            father_ht = Father,
                            mother_ht = Mother,
                            child_sex = Child,
                            child_ht = Height)

 
```

#### Dataset #2

Select the variables `familyid` and `num_children` and reduce the dataset so that it contains only one row per family. Again, use `datatable()` from the DT package to display the result.

```{r assembledata2}
dataset2 <- galtonfamilies_A %>% 
  group_by(familyid, num_children) %>%
  summarise(familyid = mean(familyid),
            num_children = mean(num_children))
```
 

### Part 1: Parent/Child Heights

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Updated Scatterplot #1

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original. Make your dots larger than the default and adjust transparency (`alpha`) to correct for overplotting and help show the density of points.

Also include the following.

* use `color` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two informative colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"`
* use `theme_linedraw()` to add some additional plot formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot1}
Scatterplot1 <- ggplot(galtonfamilies_A, aes(x = child_ht, y = midparent, color = child_sex)) +
                       geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("magenta", "mediumblue")) +
                        coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
      labs(title = "Galton child height verses average parent height", x = "child height (inches)", y = "mid-parent height (inches)", color = "gender of child") + 
      theme_linedraw() +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom")

print(Scatterplot1)



```

#### Updated Scatterplot #2

Remove the color coding for sons versus daughters from your plot, as well as any other coding related to it. Instead, choose n single color for the points and adjust both `size` and transparency (`alpha`) as needed to correct for overplotting and help show the density of points. Reset the `aes` so child height is the `y` variable and midparent height is the `x` variable. Add a fitted *straight* line to the plot. Update your `labs` accordingly.

```{r updatedscatterplot2}

Scatterplot2 <- ggplot(galtonfamilies_A, aes(x = midparent, y = child_ht,)) +
                       geom_point(size = .8, alpha = .3)  +
                        coord_fixed(ratio = 1) +
  
      labs(title = "Galton child height verses average parent height", y = "child height (inches)", x = "mid-parent height (inches)") + 
      theme_linedraw() +
      theme(legend.position = "bottom") 

print(Scatterplot2)
```

### Part 2: Number of Children

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.

```{r childrenbarplot}
barplot <- ggplot(galtonfamilies_A, aes(x = familyid, y = num_children, color = familyid)) +
         geom_col(width = .05) +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:205), guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 10)) +
         labs(title = "Number of Children Per Family", x = "Family", y = "Number of Children") +
  theme_linedraw()
print(barplot)
```

## Questions

**Question 1:** Do you think that your scatterplots are an improvement over Galton's original diagram? Are there any modifications and/or additions you would make to enhance the clarity or usefulness of your plots?

**ANSWER**
I think that the scatter plots allowed for adiquet visualization. Since galtons data compares a fairly middle range amount of data you need more then just a single scatter plot to see all of the comparisons that the data makes.

**Question 2:** Explain the rationale behind the choices you made when creating your scatterplots and barplot, such as size, color, transparency, or other features. What motivated your decisions?

**ANSWER**
I chose to use contrasting colors in order to clearly distinguish each part of the data. The transparency was lowers so that you could see points that had some overlap which I thoyght was easier for the viewer to see. I kept the size of the plots fairly small/ mid ranged since the data had so many points. 


**Question 3:** Considering best practices, how does using `coord_fixed()` enhance the authenticity of the information shown in the scatterplots, such as the relationship and spread of the data?

**ANSWER**
It forces both axis to be on the same playing field. It allows for equal visualization of data because if one axis as at a different scale then you are forced to see a skewed set of data.
